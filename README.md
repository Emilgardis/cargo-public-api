# cargo-public-api

List and diff the public API of Rust library crates between releases and commits. Detect breaking API changes and semver violations. Relies on and automatically builds [rustdoc JSON](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76578), for which a recent version of the Rust nightly toolchain must be installed.

# Installation

```bash
# Install cargo-public-api with a recent regular stable Rust toolchain
cargo install cargo-public-api

# Ensure nightly-2022-05-19 or later is installed so cargo-public-api can build rustdoc JSON for you
rustup install nightly
```

# Usage

## List the public API

This example lists the public API of the ubiquitous `regex` crate. First let's clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/regex
cd regex
```

Now we can list the public API of `regex` by doing

```bash
cargo public-api
```

which will print the public API of `regex` with one line per public item in the API:

## Diff the public API

To diff the API between say **0.2.2** and **0.2.3** of `regex`, use `--diff-git-checkouts 0.2.2 0.2.3` while standing in the git repo. Like this:

```bash
cargo public-api --diff-git-checkouts 0.2.2 0.2.3
```

and the API diff will be printed:

For more info on diffing, please read [DIFFING.md](./docs/DIFFING.md).

## Expected output

Output aims to be character-by-character identical to the textual parts of the regular `cargo doc` HTML output. For example, [this item](https://docs.rs/bat/0.20.0/bat/struct.PrettyPrinter.html#method.input_files) has the following textual representation in the rendered HTML:

```
pub fn input_files<I, P>(&mut self, paths: I) -> &mut Self
where
    I: IntoIterator<Item = P>,
    P: AsRef<Path>,
```

and `cargo public-api` represents this item in the following manner:

```
pub fn bat::PrettyPrinter::input_files<I, P>(&mut self, paths: I) -> &mut Self where I: IntoIterator<Item = P>, P: AsRef<Path>
```

If we normalize by removing newline characters and adding some whitespace padding to get the alignment right for side-by-side comparison, we can see that they are exactly the same, except an irrelevant trailing comma:

```
pub fn                     input_files<I, P>(&mut self, paths: I) -> &mut Self where I: IntoIterator<Item = P>, P: AsRef<Path>,
pub fn bat::PrettyPrinter::input_files<I, P>(&mut self, paths: I) -> &mut Self where I: IntoIterator<Item = P>, P: AsRef<Path>
```

## Blanket implementations

By default, blanket implementations such as `impl<T> Any for T`, `impl<T> Borrow<T> for T`, and `impl<T, U> Into<U> for T where U: From<T>` are omitted from the list of public items of a crate. For the vast majority of use cases, blanket implementations are not of interest, and just creates noise.

Use `--with-blanket-implementations` if you want to include items of blanket implementations in the output:
```bash
cargo public-api --with-blanket-implementations
```
